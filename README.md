Update 1: My first project in Swift. A small app that retrieves the Premier League standings and displays them in a table view.

Update 2: App now has tab view to view the matches/scores for the current matchday.

Update 3: Added more style and pull to refresh on both views + Shows game time and date based on devices timezone!

Update 4: Made UI better. Added Full team schedules when a team is selected from standings. Also added a view when a match is selected that shows the past 10 head to head matchups between the teams. Plus, implemented navigation controllers for further development if neccesary.
