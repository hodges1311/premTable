Version 1: My first project in Swift. A small app that retrieves the Premier League standings and displays them in a table view.

Version 2: App now has tab view to view the matches/scores for the current matchday.

Version 3: Added more style and pull to refresh on both views + Shows game time and date based on devices timezone!
